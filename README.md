# Single-Cycle-MIPS-processor
Verilog design of Single Cycle MIPS processor

This is the basic single cysle design without pipelining, feedback, feedforward or hazard correction. 
To learn the MIPS architecture, start the code from the most basic design of teh inverter. 
"Inverter.v" is the first file in the reposiitory.
To learn more about the MIPS architecture refer to the book "Computer Organization and Design"
To study verilog further, refer to 
"Verilog HDL: A Guide to Digital Design and Synthesis, Second Edition by Samir Palnitkar"

Commit only verified files and maintaining the modelling style of the codes.
